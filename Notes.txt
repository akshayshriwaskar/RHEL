What is Bash?
:-Bash, short for Bourne-Again Shell, is a command-line interface (CLI) shell program that's commonly used in Linux and other Unix-based operating systems. It's the default shell in many Linux distributions.

# root user (super user)

$=local user (he can not make any security or root dir changes)

Which:- allows users to search the list of paths in the $PATH environment variable and outputs the full path of the command specified as an argument.

Shell Basics:- 
- Command to run
- Options to adjust the behaviour of the command
- Arguments, which are typically targets of the command.

i.e 
ls (simple command)
ls -all (optons)
ls -ld Desktop/ (arguments)
