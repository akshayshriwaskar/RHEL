What is Bash?
:-Bash, short for Bourne-Again Shell, is a command-line interface (CLI) shell program that's commonly used in Linux and other Unix-based operating systems. It's the default shell in many Linux distributions.

# root user (super user)

$=local user (he can not make any security or root dir changes)

echo = a built-in tool that displays text, variables, or special characters to the standard output, usually the terminal screen. I

w = Show who is logged on and what they are doing.

Which:- allows users to search the list of paths in the $PATH environment variable and outputs the full path of the command specified as an argument.
i.e., which ls, which pwd.

Shell Basics:- 
- Command to run
- Options to adjust the behaviour of the command
- Arguments, which are typically targets of the command.

i.e 
ls (simple command)
ls -all (optons)
ls -ld Desktop/ (arguments)


ctrl+shift+n = To open multiple terminal

It is an interface for users where user text commands and manage tasks.

Types of Terminal:
Total 6 physical terminal types
tty1,tty2,tty3,tty4,tty5,tty6
# ctrl+alt+f3
tty1-tty2
tty1 for login shell
tty2 for gui shell

Note( rhel 7 supports login and terminal gui same tty1)

# ctrl+alt+f3 = tty3-tty6 console used by CLI
chvt
logout

Poweroff & Logout:-

poweroff
reboot
init 6
init 5 GUI Mode

How to Manage Control Panel (Setting):
passwd username = to set user password. i.e., passwd root
man = Man command displays the user manual for any command that can be run on the terminal. i., man ls, man w.

Check File Types:
file pathaddress i.e.,  file home/newfile.txt

cat /etc/passwd:

plain text configuration file that stores user account information. It contains information such as the user's name, ID, group ID, home directory, and encrypted password. The file is owned by root and has rw-r--r-- permissions, which means that anyone can read it, but only root or a user with sudo privileges can write to it.

head:- i.e., head -n 3 /etc/passwd
tail   i.e., tail -n 3 /etc/passwd

The head command will output the first part of the file, while the tail command will print the last part of the file.

wc: 
wc - print newline, word, and byte counts for each file i.e., wc /etc/passwd

wc -l = print the newline counts i.e., wc -l /etc/passwd
wc -c = print the byte counts i.e., wc -c /etc/passwd
wc -m = print the character counts wc -m /etc/passwd

/etc/passwd = stores user account information and is a plain text file.
/etc/shadow = stores hashed passwords and other user authentication information.  
/etc/group = contains information about all the groups on a system, including their names, passwords, IDs, and members.
/etc/gshadow = stores backup information about groups, such as hashed passwords and other security information.
